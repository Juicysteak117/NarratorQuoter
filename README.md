# NarratorQuoter
Narrator quotes from Darkest Dungeon always at the ready. Simple script written up in AutoHotKey because I was bored.

The script sends a random Narrator quote. The quotes have been somewhat curated so that things like boss quotes or video quotes aren't in the list. Now you can bust out a quote at any instant that you see fit.

The quotes have been formatted for Markdown so as to work nicely on Discord and Reddit. 

How to do it:
1. Run the executable file.
2. Find a text field where you want to write the quote.
3. WIN+CTRL+LSHIFT+N
4. Tada! Now you have a quote.

You might be wondering "Why is it such a wonky hotkey?" to which I say that you it nearly guarantees that you won't accidentally do it not will there ever be any overlap with any other programs. It's not too bad once you get the hang of it, just the corner keys and N, assuming you have a standard QWERTY keyboard. Sorry to the rest of you!


Credit for all of the lines goes to RedHook. Big shoutout to them for making a great game.
